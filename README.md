This web application is a studio concept created in Django. A user logs in, creates a studio, searches for the songs he wants to play and adds it to his session. Other participants can join the session and listen to music real time and also chat among the host and the participants. This feature is enabled by the use of Django Channels, websockets, Redis, PostgreSQL and evergreen HTML and CSS, to provide unique seamless web application experience.
